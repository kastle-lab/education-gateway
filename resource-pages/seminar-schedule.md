| **Geospatial AI & Digital Twins in Infrastructure** | **Song Gao** (Geospatial Data Science Lab at UW Madison, NSF AI Institute ICICLE) | February 12 at 15:00‚Äì16:00 EST | Song Gao leads the Geospatial Data Science Lab at UW Madison and on the NSF AI Institute [ICICLE](https://aiinstitutes.org/institute-icicle/) project. Dr. Gao has developed a Geospatial Knowledge Graph (GeoKG) and various Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based data analytics and resilience measures. The GeoKG is currently being used to represent food supply networks. You can find an earlier presentation by Dr. Gao on Geospatial AI and Digital Twins in Contemporary Infrastructure [here](https://digitaltwin.stcenter.net/index.php/digital-twins-webinar-5/). |

| **AI for Entity Resolution & Entity Resolved Knowledge Graphs** | **Jeff Jonas**, Founder and CEO, Senzing, Inc., and **Paco Nathan**, Senzing Knowledge Graph Practice Leader and Principal Developer Relations Engineer | June 11, 2025, 15:00‚Äì16:00 EDT | Jeff Jonas, founder and CEO of Senzing, is a data scientist and creator of Entity Resolution systems. For more than three decades, he has been at the forefront of solving complex big data problems for companies and governments. National Geographic recognized him as the Wizard of Big Data. Jonas sold his last company to IBM in 2005. Prior to founding Senzing, Jonas served as an IBM Fellow and Chief Scientist of Context Computing at IBM. He led a team focused on creating next-generation AI for Entity Resolution technology, code-named G2. At IBM G2 was deployed in many innovative ways, including modernizing U.S. voter registration through a joint effort with Pew Charitable Trust and helping the Singaporean government build a maritime domain awareness system to better protect the Malacca Strait. In 2016, Jonas founded Senzing, based on a one-of-a-kind IBM spinout of the G2 technology and team.  <br> Paco Nathan, Principal Developer Relations Engineer at Senzing, is a prominent data scientist and innovator, having decades of experience working with machine learning, natural language and graph technologies. Paco is known as a ‚Äúplayer/coach‚Äù with 40+ years of experience from Bell Labs to early-stage start-ups. His former roles include Director, Learning Group at O‚ÄôReilly Media and Director, Community Evangelism for Apache Spark at Databricks. |
