## EduGate Onboarding Questionnaire Assessment Guide

### Purpose of the Questionnaire
The EduGate Onboarding Questionnaire is designed to categorize respondents based on
their background, knowledge level, and intended use of Knowledge Graphs (KGs). The
assessment will help align onboarding materials and training resources with user
needs. Find the established Personas [here.](./personas.md)

### Assessment Process
1. Collect Responses
    * Ensure that all questionnaire responses are gathered and recorded systematically.
2. Categorization Using the Questionnaire Key
    * Each question corresponds to a predefined category of personas (e.g., Ethan the
    Enthusiast, Debbie the Developer). The responses should be mapped to these personas
    using the EduGate Questionnaire Key.
3. Assigning Persona Scores
    * Each response contributes to a persona score based on the mapping in the key.
    * Identify the respondent’s answer for each question.
    * Cross-reference the answer with the corresponding persona in the key.
    * Assign the designated points to that persona.
4. Calculating Final Persona Alignment
    * Sum the points assigned to each persona.
    * The persona with the highest total score represents the respondent’s primary
    classification.
