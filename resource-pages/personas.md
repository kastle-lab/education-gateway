## Enthusiast

**The Ethan** <br> **Graduate Student**

I am a college graduate student pursuing my thesis. My research is in biomedical engineering but the path my research is taking requires the use of Knowledge Graphs! I strive to have the tools to know how to deploy every aspect of my research, however, I currently lack the knowledge and background needed to implement the Knowledge Graph part of my research. I am a visual learner, but I don't have a lot of time to spare to take the university courses that could help catch me up to where I need to be. I need something that can teach me the basics but I also need it to fit into my busy research schedule.

For someone with a similar background, who has no previous knowledge of what a knowledge graph is or how to use one the optimal learning path would be:

Learning Steps:

As a developer, I am proficient in Python and C++ while also having an understanding of Set Theory and Propositional Knowledge. While taking this new role in this project, I must add to my skills and preliminary knowledge to familiarize myself with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) both in theory but in practice.

**The Darwin** <br> **Data Scientist**  

(Convincing perspective) I am a Data Scientist currently working in a corporate role mostly analyzing and sorting HR related data. While on a seminar my company sent me on regarding new data analysis tools, I got introduced to the KG usage.

## Educational Facilitator

**The Elias**

I am an Educational Facilitator for the [Integrated Justice Platform (IJP)](https://scales-okn.org/integrated-justice-project/) Theme, working at the intersection of education, data science, and social impact. My role involves bridging the gap between the technical team developing the platform and the educators, researchers, and practitioners who will use it to drive data-informed insights. I engage with high-interest users—including faculty, graduate students, and policy professionals—who are eager to understand and apply computational tools in their work but may need guidance in navigating complex data environments. As an educator, my goal is to translate the sophisticated technical infrastructure of the IJP into clear, usable knowledge that fosters both curiosity and capability among diverse audiences.

Elias background in knowledge graphs is limited, so I need a learning path that begins with the fundamentals of RDF, ontologies, and linked data, and progresses to hands-on work in building and querying graphs.

## Curriculum Developer

**The Cameron**

 am a Curriculum Developer for the [DREAM-KG](https://dreamkg.com) Theme, focused on designing educational materials that connect data science with social impact. My role centers on building a curriculum that helps undergraduate and graduate students; especially those in social work understand how computational tools can be used to address complex social issues like homelessness. I have experience developing learning modules that make technical subjects accessible to diverse audiences, but my direct experience with knowledge graphs is limited. I am motivated by the opportunity to translate the technical framework of DREAM-KG into clear, meaningful educational pathways that empower students to apply data-driven approaches to real-world social problems.

 My knowledge of knowledge graph theory and ontology modeling is at an early stage, and I need a structured foundation to build from. I want to learn the theoretical aspects of KGs, including their semantic structure, ontology design, and how they represent interconnected social data.

## Executive Engagement Specialist

**The Ella**

I am an Executive Engagement Specialist working with a team focused on promoting the business value of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to executives.

My goal is to showcase the outcomes and benefits through high-level, accessible materials that resonate with their business objectives.

Learning Steps:
- Understanding Digital Twins: Highlight how KGs can act as digital twins, providing a comprehensive and real-time representation of data and processes, which is a concept many executives are familiar with.
- Outcome-Driven Learning: Provide materials (e.g., videos, infographics) that focus on the business outcomes of using KGs, such as improved decision-making, strategic insights, and operational efficiencies.
- Unified Interface for Data Interaction: Explain the importance of a unified interface for executives to easily explore and interact with the data within the KG.
