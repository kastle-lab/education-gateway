## Enthusiast

**The Ethan** <br> **Graduate Student**

I am a college graduate student pursuing my thesis. My research is in biomedical engineering but the path my research is taking requires the use of Knowledge Graphs! I strive to have the tools to know how to deploy every aspect of my research, however, I currently lack the knowledge and background needed to implement the Knowledge Graph part of my research. I am a visual learner, but I don't have a lot of time to spare to take the university courses that could help catch me up to where I need to be. I need something that can teach me the basics but I also need it to fit into my busy research schedule.

For someone with a similar background, who has no previous knowledge of what a knowledge graph is or how to use one the optimal learning path would be:
- Learn what a knowledge graph is.
- The fundamentals of a knowledge graph.
- How to design and implement a knowledge graph.
